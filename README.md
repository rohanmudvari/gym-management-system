# gym-management-system
This is my first project that I built for college practical. This is just a simple front end interface website built using HTML, CSS, JS and JQuery. It is not mobile compitable. I am sharing this just for a sake of sharing some of my creation with rest of the world.
Basically, the idea was to build a Gym Management System.
The website for Gym where user could get the information regarding different facilities at the gym, get the contact information and register online.
Not only the user could get the information about the gym and register, we have provided the basic workout information for the beginners.
The mental factor is the biggest thing before carrying out any task. Having seeing that most of the people are not mentally strong to join gym or give continuity to it, we motivate our users through our website.
